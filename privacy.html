		<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
		<p>
		Thanks for entrusting KeyCat with your personal information. Holding onto your private information is a serious responsibility,
		and we want you to know how we're handling it.
		</p>

		<h3>The short version</h3>
		<p>
		We only collect the information you choose to give us, and we process it with your consent, or on another legal basis; we
		only require the minimum amount of personal information that is necessary to fulfill the purpose of your interaction
		with us; we don't sell it to third parties; and we only use it as this Privacy Statement describes. If you're visiting
		us from the EU, please see our
		<a href="#global-practices">global privacy practices</a>: we comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). No matter where you are,
		where you live, or what your citizenship is, we provide the same standard of privacy protection to all our users
		around the world, regardless of their country of origin or location.
		</p>
		<p>Of course, the short version doesn't tell you everything, so please read on for more details!</p>

		<h3 id="info-we-collect">What information KeyCat collects and why</h3>
		<h4>Information from website browsers</h4>
		<p>
		If you're
		<strong>just browsing the website</strong>, we collect the same basic information that most websites collect. We use common
		internet technologies, such as cookies and web server logs. This is stuff we collect from everybody, whether they
		have an account or not.
		</p>
		<p>
		The information we collect about all visitors to our website includes the visitor's browser type, language preference, referring
		site, additional websites requested, and the date and time of each visitor request. We also collect potentially personally-identifying
		information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.
		</p>
		<p>
		We collect this information to better understand how our website visitors use KeyCat, and to monitor and protect the security
		of the website.
		</p>
		<h4>Information from users with accounts</h4>
		<p>
		If you
		<strong>create an account</strong>, we require some basic information at the time of account creation. You will create your
		own password, and we will ask you for a valid email address. You also have the option to give us more information
		if you want to, and this may include "User Personal Information."
		</p>
		<p>
		"User Personal Information" is any information about one of our users which could, alone or together with other information,
		personally identify him or her. Information such as an email address and a real name are examples of "User Personal
		Information." User Personal Information includes Personal Data as defined in the General Data Protection Regulation.
		</p>
		<p>
		User Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information. We may use aggregated, non-personally
		identifying information to operate, improve, and optimize our website and service.
		</p>
		<h5>Why we collect this</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>We need your User Personal Information to create your account, and to provide the services you request, including
				to provide the KeyCat service, or to respond to support requests.</li>
			<li>We use your User Personal Information, specifically your email address, to identify you on KeyCat.</li>
			<li>We will use your email address to communicate with you. Please see our section on
				<a href="#communicate">email communication</a> for more information.</li>
			<li>We use your User Personal Information for internal purposes, such as to maintain logs for security reasons, for training
				purposes, and for legal documentation.</li>
			<li>We limit our use of your User Personal Information to the purposes listed in this Privacy Statement. If we need to
				use your User Personal Information for other purposes, we will ask your permission first.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5>Our legal basis for processing information</h5>
		<p>
		Under certain international laws (including GDPR), KeyCat is required to notify you about the legal basis on which we
		process User Personal Information. KeyCat processes User Personal Information on the following legal bases:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>When you create a KeyCat account, you provide your email address. We require this data element for you to enter
				into the Terms of Service agreement with us, and we process this element on the basis of performing that contract.
				We also process your email address on other bases. If you have a paid account with us, there will be other data
				elements we must collect and process on the basis of performing that contract. KeyCat does not collect or
				process a credit card number, but our third-party payment processor (Stripe, Braintree, and PayPal) does.</li>
			<li>When you fill out the information in your user profile, you have the option to provide User Personal Information
				such as your full name. We process this information on the basis of consent. All of this information is entirely
				optional, and you have the ability to access, modify, and delete it at any time.</li>
			<li>Generally, the remainder of the processing of personal information we perform is necessary for the purposes of our
				legitimate interests.</li>
			<li>If you would like to request erasure of data we process on the basis of consent, please see the section on
				<a href="#control-data">how you can access and control the information we collect</a>.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>What information KeyCat does not collect</h3>
		<p>
		We do not intentionally collect
		<strong>sensitive personal information</strong>, such as social security numbers, genetic data, health information, or religious
		information. Although KeyCat does not request or intentionally collect any sensitive personal information, we
		realize that you might store this kind of information in your account. If you store any sensitive personal information
		on our servers, you are responsible for complying with any regulatory controls regarding that data.
		</p>

		<h3>How we share the information we collect</h3>
		<p>
		We do share User Personal Information so we can perform services you have requested or communicate on your behalf. You may
		indicate, through your actions on KeyCat, that you are willing to share your User Personal Information. For example,
		if you join an organization, the owner of the organization will have the ability to view your activity in the organization's
		access log.
		</p>
		<p>
		We
		<strong>do not</strong> share, sell, rent, or trade User Personal Information with third parties for their commercial purposes.
		</p>
		<p>
		We
		<strong>do not</strong> host advertising on KeyCat. We may occasionally embed content from third party sites, such as
		YouTube, and that content may include ads. While we try to minimize the amount of ads our embedded content contains,
		we can't always control what third parties show.
		</p>
		<p>
		We <strong>do not</strong> disclose User Personal Information outside KeyCat, except in the situations listed in this section
		or in the section below on <a href="#compelled-disclosure">Compelled Disclosure</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
		We
		<strong>do</strong> share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information with others about how our users, collectively,
		use KeyCat, or how our users respond to our paid service offerings, such as a premium membership. For example,
		we may compile statistics on the number of active users on the platform. However, we do not sell this information
		to advertisers or marketers.
		</p>
		<p>
		We
		<strong>do</strong> share User Personal Information with a limited number of third party vendors who process it on our behalf
		to provide or improve our service, and who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar to our own Privacy Statement.
		Our vendors perform services such as payment processing, customer support ticketing, network data transmission, and
		other similar services. While KeyCat processes all User Personal Information in the United States, our third party
		vendors may process data outside of the United States or the European Union.
		</p>
		<p>
		We
		<strong>do</strong> share aggregated, non-personally identifying information with third parties. For example, in the event
		of a security incident, we may share the number of times a particular account was accessed.
		</p>
		<p>
		We may share User Personal Information if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition. If any such change of ownership
		happens, we will ensure that it is under terms that preserve the confidentiality of User Personal Information, and
		we will notify you on our website or by email before any transfer of your User Personal Information. The organization
		receiving any User Personal Information will have to honor any promises we have made in our Privacy Statement or
		in our Terms of Service.
		</p>
		<h4>KeyCat applications</h4>
		<p>
		You also have the option of using applications from KeyCat, such as our Desktop or Mobile app. All KeyCat applications
		are subject to this Privacy Statement, and we will always collect the minimum amount of User Personal Information
		necessary, and use it only for the purpose for which you have given it to us.
		</p>

		<h3 id="control-data">How you can access and control the information we collect</h3>
		<p>
		If you're already a KeyCat user, you may access, update, alter, or delete your basic user profile information by editing
		your user profile.
		</p>
		<h4>Data retention and deletion</h4>
		<p>
		Generally, KeyCat will retain User Personal Information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide
		you services.
		</p>
		<p>
		We may retain certain User Personal Information indefinitely, unless you delete it or request its deletion. For example,
		we don't automatically delete inactive user accounts, so unless you choose to delete your account, we will retain
		your account information indefinitely.
		</p>
		<p>
		If you would like to cancel your account or delete your User Personal Information, you may do so in your settings page.
		We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations,
		resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile (within reason) within 30 days.
		</p>

		<h3>Our use of cookies and tracking</h3>
		<h4>Cookies</h4>
		<p>
		KeyCat uses cookies to make interactions with our service easy and meaningful. We use cookies (and similar technologies,
		like HTML5 localStorage) to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, and provide information for future development
		of KeyCat. We also use cookies to identify a device, for security reasons. By using our website, you agree that
		we can place these types of cookies on your computer or device. If you disable your browser or device's ability to
		accept cookies, you may not be able to log in or properly use KeyCat's services.
		</p>
		<h4>Tracking and analytics</h4>
		<p>
		We use a number of third party analytics and service providers (such as Google Analytics) to help us evaluate our users'
		use of KeyCat; compile statistical reports on activity; and improve our content and website performance. In addition,
		we use our own internal analytics software to provide features and improve our content and performance.
		</p>
		<p>
		We do not currently respond to your browser's Do Not Track signal, and we do not permit third parties other than our analytics
		and service providers to track KeyCat users' activity over time on KeyCat. We do not track your online browsing
		activity on other online services over time.
		</p>
		<p>
		Google provides further information about its own privacy practices and
		<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">offers a browser add-on to opt out of Google Analytics tracking</a> if you so choose.
		</p>

		<h3>How KeyCat secures your information</h3>
		<p>
		KeyCat takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect User Personal Information from unauthorized access, alteration,
		or destruction; maintain data accuracy; and help ensure the appropriate use of User Personal Information.
		</p>
		<p>KeyCat enforces a written security information program. Our program:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>aligns with industry recognized frameworks;</li>
			<li>includes security safeguards reasonably designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience
				of our users' data;</li>
			<li>is appropriate to the nature, size, and complexity of KeyCat's business operations;</li>
			<li>includes incident response and data breach notification processes; and</li>
			<li>complies with applicable information security related laws and regulations in the geographic regions where KeyCat
				does business.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		In the event of a data breach that affects your User Personal Information, we will act promptly to mitigate the impact of
		a breach and notify any affected users.
		</p>
		<p>
		Transmission of data on KeyCat is encrypted using SSH, HTTPS, and SSL/TLS. By design, your vault information is encrypted
		prior to being transmitted to our servers and is therefore encrypted at rest.
		</p>

		<h3 id="global-practices">KeyCat's global privacy practices</h3>
		<p>
		<strong>We store and process the information that we collect in the United States</strong> in accordance with this Privacy
		Statement (our subprocessors may store and process data outside the United States). However, we understand that we
		have users from different countries and regions with different privacy expectations, and we try to meet those needs
		even when the United States does not have the same privacy framework as other countries'.
		</p>
		<p>
		We provide the same standard of privacy protection — as described in this Privacy Statement — to all our users around the
		world, regardless of their country of origin or location, and we are proud of the levels of notice, choice, accountability,
		security, data integrity, access, and recourse we provide. We work hard to comply with the applicable data privacy
		laws wherever we do business.
		</p>
		<p>In particular:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>KeyCat provides clear methods of unambiguous, informed consent at the time of data collection, when we do collect
				your personal data using consent as a basis.</li>
			<li>We collect only the minimum amount of personal data necessary for our purposes, unless you choose to provide more.
				We encourage you to only give us the amount of data you are comfortable sharing.</li>
			<li>We offer you simple methods of accessing, correcting, or deleting the User Personal Information we have collected.</li>
			<li>We provide our users notice, choice, accountability, security, and access, and we limit the purpose for processing.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="compelled-disclosure">How we respond to compelled disclosure</h3>
		<p>
		KeyCat may disclose personally-identifying information or other information we collect about you to law enforcement in
		response to a valid subpoena, court order, warrant, or similar government order, or when we believe in good faith
		that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our property or rights, or those of third parties or the public
		at large.
		</p>
		<p>
		In complying with court orders and similar legal processes, KeyCat strives for transparency. When permitted, we will make
		a reasonable effort to notify users of any disclosure of their information, unless we are prohibited by law or court
		order from doing so, or in rare, exigent circumstances.
		</p>

		<h3 id="communicate">How we, and others, communicate with you</h3>
		<p>
		We will use your email address to communicate with you. For example, if you contact our support team with a request, we will
		respond to you via email.
		</p>
		<p>
		KeyCat may occasionally send notification emails about new features, requests for feedback, important policy changes,
		or offer customer support. We also send marketing emails. There's an unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each
		of the marketing emails we send you. Please note that you can not opt out of receiving important communications from
		us, such as mails from our support team or system emails.
		</p>
		<p>
		Our emails might contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have opened an email
		and what your IP address is. We use this pixel tag to make our email more effective for you and to make sure we're
		not sending you unwanted email.
		</p>

		<h3>Changes to our Privacy Statement</h3>
		<p>
		Although most changes are likely to be minor, KeyCat may change our Privacy Statement from time to time.
		</p>
